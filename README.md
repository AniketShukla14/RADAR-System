# Radar-System
<li>A Radar System is created by using Arduino codes which tells the distance as well as the angle of the target.</li>
<li>I created this project in my first year to take part in a exhibition context where I won the 2nd prize.</li>
<li>This Radar System is given a name Snake Eyes whose job is to look at any object coming to its range.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
It's good radar system which can detect obstacle up to 25 cm (according to the range of ultrasonic sensor) , it can also tell the distance of the obstacle from the Radar model and also the angle of the obstacle.
